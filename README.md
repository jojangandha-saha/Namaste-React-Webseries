  Two types of Export/Import

Default Export/Import
export default Component; import Component from "path";

Named Export/Import
export const Component; import {Component} from "path";

Higher oder components

- function; takes a component as input and returns a component.

- adds extra feature/ enhancing existing componenet and returns it back.

- state & props are importatnt part of components

# Props drilling

- passing data/props down from parent to grandchilderen through children
- for big application -> deep nesting followed, props drilling is a problem. keep on passing props without using it in certain componenet still needs to be passed down.

- needs some global data that can be accessed from anywhere -> React context. Context API. to avoid prop drilling.

# Redux

two libraris of react

- react-redux
- redux toolkit(RTK)

- redux works on data layer
- redux is separate library than react
- easy debugging in redux
- state management -> state container
